Challenge Description:
- I lost my dog in Minecraft. Can you find him? The name of the dog wrapped in ictf{} is the flag.
- The dog's name is 16 hex characters, anything else is not correct.


Let's look at all available hints:
- img.png: photo of a black dog with blue collar
- \world\advancements: "DataVersion": 3953
  - The given minecraft version is 1.21
  - So blue collar is id: 11
- \world\datapacks\Dog data\data\test\function\dog.mcfunction: bunch of filtered summon info but provides information on the data field for dog in minecraft
  - The dog is a minecraft:wolf
  - Color field would be variant:black

Now let's download and use NBTExplorer:
- Expand the "world" and click on "entities"
- Go to "Search" -> "Find..." and enter:
  - Name: "id", Value: "CollarColor:11"

Under each search result, look for:
- id: "minecraft:wolf"
- variant: "minecraft:black"
- has the entry "CustomName"

The flag is ictf{6ed247d7539bb3bf}
